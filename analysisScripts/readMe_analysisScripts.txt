2018testSimulationAnalysis.C
    Oldest version of analysis script


All here need SimResult.h
2019testSimulationAnalysisV1.C
    Used for old simulations with cell cuts = zend cuts

2019testSimulationAnalysisV2.C
    Contains dual functionality to use EDMcell vacuum volume in the cells

testSimulationAnalysisV3.C
    Fixed many bugs, fixed plotting.  Updated error in days to reach.  Added more comments throught.  Still need to add more comments for Days function




cellTau.C 
    Script used for determining the storage lifetime per energy bin in the EDM cells

cellEmpty.C 
    Script used for determining collection efficiency as a function of energy for EDM cells (to the detectors)
